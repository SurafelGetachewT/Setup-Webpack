# Setup-Webpack

This is a demo on how to set up a project with webpack. Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It's intelligent enough to build all app dependencies based just on your file imports. It starts from a list of modules defined as entry points and recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module the application needs.

## Built With

- Languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Module Bundler: Webpack
- Webpack Plugin: HtmlWebpackPlugin
- Webpack Loaders: style-loader and css-loader 
- Code Editor: VS Code

### Prerequisites

- [x] A web browser like Google Chrome.
- [x] A code editor like Visual Studio Code with Git and Node.js.

You can check if Git is installed by running the following command in the terminal.
```
$ git --version
```

Likewise for Node.js and npm for package installation.
```
$ node --version && npm --version
```

### Install

In the terminal, go to your file directory and run this command.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SurafelGetachewT/Setup-Webpack.git
```

### Usage

Kindly modify the files as needed.

### Run tests

To run webpack, run the npm script by this command:

```
$ npm run build
```

To start webpack-dev-server, use this:

```
$ npm start
```
